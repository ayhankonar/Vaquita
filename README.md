# Welcome to Vaquita
Our ReactJS application is an e-commerce platform where users can shop for nice-to-have big-ticket items but at a much lower cost through raffling.
The name Vaquita ("little cow") comes from "hacer una vaca" (lit. "make a cow"), a phrase popular in Chile and Colombia (where the developer's backgrounds are) and means to pool money together to make a purchase.
